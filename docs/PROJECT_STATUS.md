# Project Status - NoSlop

## Completed Changes (2026-06-14)

### 0. HUBs Rebranding & Home Hub Vision
*   Renamed "HAI-Net" tab to "HUBs".
*   Added "HAI-Net (coming soon)" indicator to the HUBs page.
*   Documented the vision for Home HUBs as the primary backup for mesh Identity, data, and media.

### 1. Mesh Filtering & Notification Deep-links
*   Verified self-post filtering in `NoSlopViewModel.kt`.
*   Confirmed `ensurePostInFeed()` handles notification deep-links correctly by bypassing filters.

### 2. RSS Content Classification
*   Fixed `FeedParser.kt` to prevent RSS articles with embedded images from being promoted to "Image" media type.
*   Preserved extracted images as `thumbnailUrl` for use in the new article hero layout.

### 3. Wikimedia Commons Integration
*   Added `WikimediaApiClient.kt` to fetch featured pictures from Wikimedia Commons.
*   Added "Wikimedia Featured" as a built-in API source in `SourceLibrary.kt`.
*   Integrated into `PublicApiService.kt` under "Photography" and "Art" categories.
*   No API key required for this source.

### 4. Article Card Redesign & Pagination Fix
*   Implemented a rich hero layout for articles in `SegmentedArticleReader` (`MediaComponents.kt`).
*   **Fix**: Migrated to `HorizontalPager` for sideways swiping between article segments.
*   **Fix**: Removed vertical scrolling from segments to ensure they always fit the viewport and vertical "swipe away" gestures work reliably.
*   Added a "Read Full Article" button on the final page of every article.

### 5. Media Playback & Source Reliability
*   **Fix**: Resolved YouTube "Error 153" (Video Player Configuration Error) by strictly aligning the `origin` parameter in the embed URL with the `baseURL` provided to the WebView's `loadDataWithBaseURL` method.
*   **Fix**: Added `mute=1` to the YouTube embed to ensure `autoplay=1` is respected by modern browser security policies.
*   **Fix**: Updated YouTube embed logic in `VideoPlayer.kt` with a modern Mobile User-Agent and optimized iframe parameters (`origin`, `enablejsapi`, `rel=0`).
*   **Fix**: Refreshed Invidious API fallback instances with healthy servers.
*   **Fix**: Cleaned up dead RSS sources in `SourceLibrary.kt` (Self-Hosted Hero, Threatpost, etc.).

### 6. Article UX Refinements & Content Classification
*   **Fix**: Updated `GuardianApiClient` and `NewsApiClient` to ensure their articles are classified as "Article" type (`mediaType = null`) instead of being promoted to "Image" status.
*   **Fix**: Articles with missing content now correctly fall back to excerpts.
*   **Fix**: Added a high-quality default fallback hero image for articles without thumbnails.
*   **Fix**: Improved article pagination state to always show a content page with the "Read Full Article" button even when no text is extractable.

### 7. Handshake Reply Notifications
*   Added logic to notify the sender of a connection request when it is accepted (`USER_HANDSHAKE`).
*   Introduced new packet type `CONNECTION_REJECTED` to notify the sender if their request is declined, safely removing the pending peer and displaying a local notification.

## Pending / Future Work
*   Add more no-auth image and video sources.
*   Enhance WebView with ad-blocking or reader mode if possible.
*   Further optimize preloading for diverse media types.

## Completed Changes (2026-06-19)

### 1. Onboarding & Categories Refinement
*   **Auto-Included Sources**: Removed "Video Platforms" and "Social Clearnet" from the user-facing category selection list in Onboarding and Settings since these are essential and always included by the pipeline.
*   **Expanded Genres**: Added more diverse genre options to the Music and Video categories in `SourceLibrary.kt` to broaden content discovery.
*   **Creator Cloud Layout**: Replaced the fixed chunking layout with a responsive `FlowRow` in both Onboarding and Settings, preventing creator names from being truncated.
*   **Suggested Feeds UI**: Removed the search field from the "Suggested Clearnet Feeds" slide to streamline the onboarding experience.

### 2. Media Player & Feed Immersiveness
*   **Landscape Auto-Hide UI**: Implemented an immersive feed view when the device is in horizontal orientation. The top status overlays (notifications, search), bottom navigation bar, right-side interaction icons (like, share, comment), and bottom-left author details automatically slide off-screen after 1 second of inactivity. Tapping the screen instantly restores them.
*   **Edge-to-Edge Media**: Updated the main Scaffold's `innerPadding` to dynamically animate to `0dp` when the landscape UI auto-hides, allowing video and image content to fully stretch into the freed navigation bar space.
*   **ExoPlayer Resize Mode Fix**: Updated `VideoPlayer.kt` to unconditionally use `RESIZE_MODE_FIT` (instead of `RESIZE_MODE_ZOOM` in landscape). This prevents the media from becoming artificially oversized and cropped at the edges when playing in horizontal orientation.

### 3. QR Mesh Scanner Enhancements
*   **Gallery Selection Fix**: Resolved an issue where the "Select from Gallery" button was completely hidden beneath the camera preview layer (`AndroidView`). The layout was restructured into a `Column`, placing the gallery picker safely below the camera area, making it universally visible and functional.
