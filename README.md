# NoSlop 🚫🥣
### **Self-hosted media making and sharing decentralized social network.**
*Power to the creators!* ✊✨

---

## 🎯 Vision

**NoSlop** is a revolutionary framework designed to empower humanity to create high-quality content without the "slop" of low quality generated content, and the centralized control or algorithmic manipulation of the big tech companies. It leverages **your** consumer hardware to build a private, secure, and AI-driven media production studio and social network.

**Own your data. Own your creativity. Share freely and securely.** 🌍🔓

---

## 🧩 Core Modules

### 🌱 **NoSlop Seed**
*The Smart Installer*
Automatically scans your local network and deploys the NoSlop cluster across available devices. It intelligently assigns roles (Master, Compute, Storage) based on hardware capabilities (CPU, GPU, RAM).

### 🎬 **NoSlop Media Creator**
*Your AI-Powered Studio*
A local, AI-driven media production cluster.
- **Admin AI**: Your personal creative director and **Pro Editor**. Capable of editing existing footage, color grading, and compiling complex films to industry standards. 🎞️✨
- **Worker Agents**: Specialized AI agents for scriptwriting, prompting, and editing. 👷‍♂️
- **Tools**: Integrates **ComfyUI** 🎨, **FFmpeg** 🎥, and **OpenCV** 👁️ for professional-grade output.

### ⛓️ **NoSlop Blockchain**
*Decentralized Registry*
Ensures media authenticity and provenance. A tamper-proof ledger that proves **you** created your content. 🛡️

### 🕸️ **NoSlop Social Network**
*The Mesh*
A peer-to-peer, decentralized social graph. Share content directly from your node to others without intermediate servers.
- **Ad-Free & Cost-Free**: No corporate overlords, no subscription fees, no data mining, and no advertisements. 🚫💰
- **Your Feed, Your Rules**: You control the algorithm. Tweak the parameters to see exactly what you want, not what an engagement engine forces on you. 🎛️
- **Guardian LLM**: A dedicated AI agent that protects you and the network. Combined with community up/down voting, it ensures a safe environment without censorship. 🛡️🗳️

## 🏗️ Architecture & Flow

1.  **Deploy**: Run **NoSlop Seed** to turn your home devices into a supercomputer. 🚀
2.  **Create**: Chat with your **Admin AI** to brainstorm ideas. 💡
3.  **Orchestrate**: The **Project Manager Agent** breaks down your vision into tasks. 📋
4.  **Execute**: **Worker Agents** generate images, edit video, and compose audio using local tools. ⚙️
5.  **Refine**: Iterate with the AI until it's perfect. ✨
6.  **Share**: Publish to the **NoSlop Network**, verified by the **Blockchain**. 📢

## 🚀 Getting Started

> ✅ **Status**: NoSlop deployment is **operational**! **Phase 0: Shared Storage** and **Deployment Stabilization** are complete. The smart installer successfully deploys across heterogeneous multi-device networks.

### Quick Start (Recommended)

Use the **NoSlop Seed** smart installer for automated deployment even across multiple devices:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gaborkukucska/NoSlop.git
cd NoSlop

# Run the installer (dependencies auto-install on first run)
# Deploy on current device (all-in-one mode)
python3 -m seed.seed_cli --single-device

# OR deploy across multiple devices (requires ssh access to other devices on the local network)
python3 -m seed.seed_cli

# OR if you are planning to open a Cloudflare tunnel to access the local UI from the internet
NOSLOP_FRONTEND_EXTERNAL_URL=https://app.your-domain.com python3 -m seed.seed_cli

```

The installer will:
-    **Find Local Devices**: Scans your local network for available devices to deploy NoSlop on.
- 🔍 **Detect Hardware**: Analyzes CPU, RAM, GPU, and Disk to assign optimal roles.
- 🌐 **Discover Existing Services**: Scans your network for existing Ollama, ComfyUI, or PostgreSQL instances to reuse.
-    **Creates A Deployment Plan**: Based on the available devices and their capabilities, it creates a deployment plan that assigns roles to each device like this:

## 📝 Logging & Troubleshooting

NoSlop uses a comprehensive logging system to help you debug and monitor your deployment:

### Log File Locations

All logs are saved to the `logs/` folder with dated filenames for easy tracking:

```
logs/
├── seed_installer_20251203_191118.log          # Main installer logs
├── postgresql_installer_20251203_191118.log    # PostgreSQL installation
├── ollama_installer_20251203_191118.log        # Ollama installation
├── comfyui_installer_20251203_191118.log       # ComfyUI installation
├── ffmpeg_installer_20251203_191118.log        # FFmpeg installation
├── backend_installer_20251203_191118.log       # Backend installation
├── frontend_installer_20251203_191118.log      # Frontend installation
├── service_manager_20251203_191118.log         # Service management operations
└── backend_20251203_191118.log                 # Backend API runtime logs
```

### Log Levels

- **File logs**: Always capture DEBUG level for comprehensive troubleshooting
- **Console logs**: Respect user-specified log level (INFO by default)

### Viewing Logs

```bash
# View latest installer log
tail -f logs/seed_installer_*.log | tail -1

# View specific service installer logs
tail -f logs/postgresql_installer_*.log | tail -1

# View backend runtime logs
tail -f logs/backend_*.log | tail -1

# Search for errors across all logs
grep -r "ERROR" logs/

# Search for warnings
grep -r "WARNING" logs/
```

### Common Issues

Check the relevant log files if you encounter issues:
- **Installation failures**: Check `{service}_installer_*.log` files
- **Service startup issues**: Check `backend_*.log` or systemd logs with `journalctl -u noslop-backend`
- **Service management**: Check `service_manager_*.log`
